My name is Darya and I am here to document how I **panic** through my programming journey. As a **self taught Font-End Developer** I wanted to find a way to panic more effciently. I read that writing about what you build allows you to get a clear and concise idea of your thinking and methods, therefore improving your learning process.

This blog picks up at the end of my internship, when I am panicking about `REACTjs` and some Back-End, while trying to get my first Front-End job. 

In fact, I started my panicking journey back in 2019 with a Reponsive Web Design course from Free Code Camp, followed by the CS50 Introduction to Computer Science. At that point I have panicked through and mastered `HTML`, `CSS` and `JS`, could work with `C` and easily wrote queries in `SQL`. I backed up these with some projects, like websites for friends, my personal portfolio and small cool applications. All this panicking landed me my internship as Front-End develper in September 2020.
